				<p>This page is about my different hobbies...</p>

				<h2>Sport</h2>
				<p>Firstly, i'm fond of sports, i did so many of them and i practiced a lot until competing in multiple disciplines. My favorite ones until that day are boxing, swimming, climbing, but the best really are surfing and skiing.</p>

			<div class="card-white">
				<h2>Video-games</h2>
				<p>I always played video games. It was the hobby i spent the most of my free time doing. I particularly liked adventure games, the one you can get lost in and spend hours just traveling and discovering a brand new world. Among my favorites, we can find Hollow knoght, Fallout and Zelda.</p>

			<div class="card-white">
				<h2>Poetry</h2>
				<p>After learning a little about poetry in school,i completely fell in love with the art of the words. After hours studying it, the last thing i had to do is try it out myself, and that's what i did! Turns out it's quite complicated and time onsuming, but when you put your heart nto it, you can acheive some nice things. Today i love writing and continue doing it often.</p>

				<h2>Minifigurines</h2>
				<p>My last big hobby is building/painting minifigures. They are either called wharammer or gundams. They are very VERY time consuming but also very rewarding when we finish building them. I'm actually making a collection. I love spending my time building them while watching a serie and then exposing them on a shelve to show my hard work to everyone.</p>
